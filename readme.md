# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using PyTorch

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates how to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. The notebook also shows how to use advanced data augmentation techniques to improve the performance of the model.

## Problem Statement

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify the images into their corresponding classes.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need to have a Google account and a working internet connection. The notebook is designed to run on Google Colab, which provides a free GPU runtime.

## Usage

The notebook is self-contained and includes all the necessary code to load the dataset, train the model, and evaluate its performance. The notebook is well-commented, so it should be easy to follow along and understand the code.

You can either run the notebook on Google Colab, or you can download it and run it on your local machine using Jupyter Notebook.

## Results

The model is able to achieve an accuracy of around 71% on the test dataset without any data augmentation. With advanced data augmentation techniques like Cutout, Mixup and Dropout, the model's accuracy improves to around 76%. However, achieving an accuracy of 99% on the CIFAR-10 dataset is a challenging task and may require a combination of several techniques and fine-tuning.

## Conclusion

This notebook provides a good starting point for experimenting with the CIFAR-10 dataset and PyTorch. The code is easy to understand and can be easily adapted to other datasets and models. The use of advanced data augmentation techniques can help to improve the performance of the model.

## Note

Please keep in mind that training a model with a high accuracy is not the only goal, you may want to consider other factors such as computational cost, interpretability, and generalization capabilities of the model.
